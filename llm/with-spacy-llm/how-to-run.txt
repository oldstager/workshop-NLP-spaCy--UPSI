1.  Set environment variables (example here uses Bash, make any necessary adjustment for other OS/env/shell):

export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export OPENAI_API_ORG="org-..."

Note: get your own keys from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2.  Run using this pattern:

python run_pipeline.py [TEXT] [PATH TO CONFIG] [PATH TO FILE WITH EXAMPLES]

Examples:

$ python run_pipeline.py "You look great today! Nice shirt!" ./zeroshot.cfg
$ python run_pipeline.py "You look great today! Nice shirt!" ./fewshot.cfg ./examples.jsonl
